1. have every function be input to output:
    avoid having a function mutatate an input variable. Rather, have a function
    output a different variable that what was inputed. This creates a chain of followable function calls
    based on the variables passed in and returned out. This is easier to read and build upon.

2. Horizontal layout
    avoid nested structures. This allows the program to scale easily, borrow data easier, and be more readable. Avoid nesting and vertical growth at all costs!
